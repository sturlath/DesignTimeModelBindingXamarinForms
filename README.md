# Design time model binding in Xamar Forms
How to use class model for design time data in XAML in Xamarin.Forms. 

The reason for this was that the docs on [desing time data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-previewer/design-time-data) does not explain this as nicely as I would have liked

# End results 
This is how the ListView looks (in the XAML previewer) when a C# class model is databound in a XAML.
